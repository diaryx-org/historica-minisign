//! Cutting a release, as one program.
//!
//! historica-sign releases on a tag: pushing `vX.Y.Z` starts `release.yml`,
//! which cuts the GitHub release and writes its body from the changelog.
//! Everything before that push is mechanical and easy to get half-right by
//! hand — the version lives in the manifest and the lockfile both, and the
//! changelog's unreleased region has to be cut into a released section — so it
//! lives here instead:
//!
//!     cargo xtask version                 what the repository calls itself
//!     cargo xtask bump <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z>
//!     cargo xtask changelog [--write|--check]
//!     cargo xtask release <patch|minor|major|X.Y.Z> [--push] [--no-verify]
//!     cargo xtask release-notes [tag]
//!
//! `release` stops at the tag unless it is given `--push`. That asymmetry is the
//! whole safety model: every step before the push is a local commit that can be
//! amended or thrown away, and the push is the one that puts a version number
//! somewhere other people can see it. So the push is asked for explicitly, each
//! time, and the default run prints the two commands it did not run.
//!
//! `release-notes` is what `release.yml` invokes, so the release workflow holds
//! no more knowledge about this repository than the CI workflow does: it asks
//! the program.
